# easytable

This is a (very) small project that builds upon
[Apache's PDFBox](http://pdfbox.apache.org) and should allow you
to create tables in a fairly simple way.
It emerged from the need in another project. Therefore it also may miss some
crucial features. Nevertheless there is:

*   setting font and font size on table, row and cell level
*   setting single cells with bottom-, top-, left- and right-border width separately
*   background color on table, row and cell level
*   padding (top, bottom, left, right) on cell level
*   border colors (on table, row or cell level)
*   support for text alignment (right, left, center, justified)
*   vertical text alignment (top, middle, bottom)
*   cell spanning and row spanning 
*   line breaking and line spacing
*   images in cells
*   experimental: vertical text, links and [paragraphs within cells](#paragraph-cells)

One can also override classes that are responsible for table/cell drawing, i.e. 
their drawing behaviour can be customized to a pretty high extent.

It is also possible to draw a table over multiple pages (even with the 
header row being repeated on every new page).

## Installation

Add this to your `pom.xml`:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.vandeseer</groupId>
        <artifactId>easytable</artifactId>
        <version>0.6.0</version>
    </dependency>

Or checkout the repository and install it locally with maven (e.g. for the`develop` branch):

    mvn install -DskipTests -Dgpg.skip

## Examples

There is a [minimal full working example](src/test/java/org/vandeseer/MinimumWorkingExample.java) 
which should help you getting started.  

For a bit more involved tables have a look at [this code](src/test/java/org/vandeseer/integrationtest/ExcelLikeExampleTest.java) 
which is needed for creating a PDF document with the following two tables:

![easytable table](doc/example.png)

![easytable table](doc/example2.png)

For the next example have a look at the [SettingsTest.java](src/test/java/org/vandeseer/integrationtest/SettingsTest.java):

![easytable table](doc/example3.png)

The last one illustrates the use of vertical text in text cells. The code for 
it can be found [here](src/test/java/org/vandeseer/integrationtest/VerticalTextCellTest.java):

![easytable table](doc/example4.png)

If you run the tests with `mvn clean test` there also some PDF documents created which you can find in the `target` folder.
The corresponding sources (in order to understand how to use the code) can be found in the test package.

## Paragraph Cells

Since several people asked me to include a way to add hyperlinks within cells I did a bit of research
and stumbled across a really nice library named [pdfbox-layout](https://github.com/ralfstuckert/pdfbox-layout). Unfortunately it will not be developed 
any further, but it still provides a very nice API for creating paragraphs with "styled text" (including links
as well as markup). 

Paragraphs can contain:
- Hyperlinks
- StyledText (i.e. colorable text with a font and font size)
- Markup

Therefore I created a wrapper cell type (named `ParagraphCell`) which allows you to 
create such tables for instance: 

TODO: Image

This is still a bit experimental. 

If you want to use this feature you need to add pdfbox-layout as a dependency. 
In case you are using maven for instance in your `pom.xml`:

    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>jitpack.io</id>
            <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.ralfstuckert.pdfbox-layout</groupId>
        <artifactId>pdfbox2-layout</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
        <exclusions>
            <exclusion>
                <groupId>org.apache.pdfbox</groupId>
                <artifactId>pdfbox</artifactId>
            </exclusion>
        </exclusions>
    </dependency>

Please note that you also need to set the `page(...)` on the `TableDrawer` you are using
in case you want to add hyperlinks! Otherwise you will get a `NullPointerException`.

## Q&A

### Can I customize the drawers for my own specific needs?

Yep, you can customize the cell drawers itself or (depending on your use case)
you can just create a custom cell. 

For using a customized cell drawer, have a look at 
[CustomCellDrawer](src/test/java/org/vandeseer/integrationtest/custom/CustomCellDrawer.java).

In case you want to create your own type of cell (which shouldn't really be necessary since the 
drawing can be completely adapted) you will need to use [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/)'s `@SuperBuilder`
annotation. Again, just have a look at the code: 
[CustomCellWithCustomDrawerUsingLombok](src/test/java/org/vandeseer/integrationtest/custom/CustomCellWithCustomDrawerUsingLombok.java)

### Can I draw a table over multiple pages?

Yes, have a look at [TableOverSeveralPagesTest.java](src/test/java/org/vandeseer/integrationtest/TableOverSeveralPagesTest.java).
Just use `startY(...)`  and `endY(..)` in order to restrict the vertical part of the page 
where the table should be drawn: 

    RepeatedHeaderTableDrawer.builder()
        .table(createTable())
        .startX(50)
        .startY(100F)
        .endY(50F) // <-- If the table is bigger, a new page is started
        .build()

### Does it work with Java < 8?

Nope. You will need at least Java 8.

### Does it work with PDFBox 1.8.9?

Well, Using it with PDFBox 1.8.9 requires you to check out version
0.0.7 (tagged as such in git) and install it locally, i.e.:

    git checkout v0.0.7
    mvn clean install

Note though that the API has changed quite a bit in the meantime ...

### Cool, I like it, can I buy you a beer?

Yes. Or you can upvote this answer on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28059563/how-to-create-table-using-apache-pdfbox/42612456#42612456).
